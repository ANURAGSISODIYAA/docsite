## Publishing with Github Pages
To build our app and publish it to Github:

Edit your `Dioxus.toml` to point your `out_dir` to the `docs` folder and the `base_path` to the name of your repo:

```toml
[application]
# ...
out_dir = "docs"
base_path = "your_repo"
```

Then build your app and publish it to Github:

- Make sure GitHub Pages is set up for your repo to publish any static files in the docs directory
- Build your app with:
```sh
dioxus build --release
```
- Add and commit with git
- Push to GitHub
